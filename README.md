# Overview

This repository contains the source code and necessary resources/instructions to build, run and use a library management application.

The application is intended to be a simple and efficient application to aid librarians in managing books, members, and library transactions. It streamlines tasks like tracking inventory, handling checkouts and returns, and maintaining members records. 

The rest of this page will guide you through the process of installing and building the application.
